    <h2 text-center>NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT</h2><br><br><br>
    <p> THIS AGREEMENT (the "Agreement”) is entered into on this <b><u>{{nda.date}}</u></b>
      date, and between <b><u>{{nda.disclosingparty}}</u></b>, located at
      <b><u>{{nda.disclosingpartylocation}}</u></b> ( the”
      Disclosing Party”), and <b><u>{{nda.receivingparty}}</u></b> with an address at
      <b><u>{{nda.receivingpartylocation}}</u></b> (the “Receiving
      Party”).<br><br>

      The Receiving Party hereto desires to participate in discussions regarding
      <b><u>{{nda.regarding}}</u></b> (the “Transaction”). During these discussions, Disclosing Party may
      share certain proprietary information with the Receiving Party. Therefore, in consideration of the mutual promises
      and covenants contained in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency
      of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:<br>
      <b>1. Definition of Confidential Information.</b> <br><br>
      (a) For purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means any data or information that is proprietary
      to the Disclosing Party and not generally known to the public, whether in tangible or intangible form, in whatever
      medium provided, whether unmodified or modified by Receiving Party or its Representatives (as defined herein),
      whenever and however disclosed, including, but not limited to: (i) any marketing strategies, plans, financial
      information, or projections, operations, sales estimates, business plans and performance results relating to the
      past, present or future business activities of such party, its affiliates, subsidiaries and affiliated companies;
      (ii) plans for products or services, and customer or supplier lists; (iii) any scientific or technical
      information, invention, design, process, procedure, formula, improvement, technology or method; (iv) any concepts,
      reports, data, know-how, works-in-progress, designs, development tools, specifications, computer software, source
      code, object code, flow charts, databases, inventions, information and trade secrets; (v) any other information
      that should reasonably be recognized as confidential information of the Disclosing Party; and (vi) any information
      generated by the Receiving Party or by its Representatives that contains, reflects, or is derived from any of the
      foregoing. Confidential Information need not be novel, unique, patentable, copyrightable or constitute a trade
      secret in order to be designated Confidential Information. The Receiving Party acknowledges that the Confidential
      Information is proprietary to the Disclosing Party, has been developed and obtained through great efforts by the
      Disclosing Party and that Disclosing Party regards all of its Confidential Information as trade
      secrets.<br><br><br>
      (b) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, Confidential Information shall not include
      information which: a) was lawfully possessed, as evidenced by the Receiving Party’s records, by the Receiving
      Party prior to receiving the Confidential Information from the Disclosing Party; (b) becomes rightfully known by
      the Receiving Party from a third-party source not under an obligation to Disclosing Party to maintain
      confidentiality; (c) is generally known by the public through no fault of or failure to act by the Receiving Party
      inconsistent with its obligations under this Agreement; (d) is required to be disclosed in a judicial or
      administrative proceeding, or is otherwise requested or required to be disclosed by law or regulation, although
      the requirements of paragraph 4 hereof shall apply prior to any disclosure being made; and (e) is or has been
      independently developed by employees, consultants or agents of the Receiving Party without violation of the terms
      of this Agreement, as evidenced by the Receiving Party’s records, and without reference or access to any
      Confidential Information.<br>
      <b>2. Disclosure of Confidential Information.</b> <br><br>
      From time to time, the Disclosing Party may disclose Confidential Information to the Receiving Party. The
      Receiving Party will: (a) limit disclosure of any Confidential Information to its directors, officers, employees,
      agents or representatives (collectively “Representatives”) who have a need to know such Confidential Information
      in connection with the current or contemplated business relationship between the parties to which this Agreement
      relates, and only for that purpose; (b) advise its Representatives of the proprietary nature of the Confidential
      Information and of the obligations set forth in this Agreement, require such Representatives to be bound by
      written confidentiality restrictions no less stringent than those contained herein, and assume full liability for
      acts or omissions by its Representatives that are inconsistent with its obligations under this Agreement; (c) keep
      all Confidential Information strictly confidential by using a reasonable degree of care, but not less than the
      degree of care used by it in safeguarding its own confidential information; and (d) not disclose any Confidential
      Information received by it to any third parties (except as otherwise provided for herein). <br><br><br>
      <b>3. Use of Confidential Information.</b><br><br>
      The Receiving Party agrees to use the Confidential Information solely in connection with the current or
      contemplated business relationship between the parties and not for any purpose other than as authorized by this
      Agreement without the prior written consent of an authorized representative of the Disclosing Party. No other
      right or license, whether expressed or implied, in the Confidential Information is granted to the Receiving Party
      hereunder. Title to the Confidential Information will remain solely in the Disclosing Party. All use of
      Confidential Information by the Receiving Party shall be for the benefit of the Disclosing Party and any
      modifications and improvements thereof by the Receiving Party shall be the sole property of the Disclosing Party.
      Nothing contained herein is intended to modify the parties' existing agreement that their discussions in
      furtherance of a potential business relationship are governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 408.<br><br><br>

      <b>4. Compelled Disclosure of Confidential Information.</b><br><br>
      Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential
      Information pursuant to any governmental, judicial, or administrative order, subpoena, discovery request,
      regulatory request or similar method, provided that the Receiving Party promptly notifies, to the extent
      practicable, the Disclosing Party in writing of such demand for disclosure so that the Disclosing Party, at its
      sole expense, may seek to make such disclosure subject to a protective order or other appropriate remedy to
      preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information; provided that the Receiving Party will disclose only
      that portion of the requested Confidential Information that, in the written opinion of its legal counsel, it is
      required to disclose. The Receiving Party agrees that it shall not oppose and shall cooperate with efforts by, to
      the extent practicable, the Disclosing Party with respect to any such request for a protective order or other
      relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Disclosing Party is unable to obtain or does not seek a protective
      order and the Receiving Party is legally requested or required to disclose such Confidential Information,
      disclosure of such Confidential Information may be made without liability.<br><br><br>

      <b>5. Term.</b><br> <br>
      This Agreement shall remain in effect for a two-year term (subject to a one year extension if the parties are
      still discussing and considering the Transaction at the end of the second year). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
      the Receiving Party’s duty to hold in confidence Confidential Information that was disclosed during term shall
      remain in effect indefinitely.<br><br><br>
      <b>6. Remedies.</b><br><br>
      Both parties acknowledge that the Confidential Information to be disclosed hereunder is of a unique and valuable
      character, and that the unauthorized dissemination of the Confidential Information would destroy or diminish the
      value of such information. The damages to Disclosing Party that would result from the unauthorized dissemination
      of the Confidential Information would be impossible to calculate. Therefore, both parties hereby agree that the
      Disclosing Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief preventing the dissemination of any Confidential
      Information in violation of the terms hereof. Such injunctive relief shall be in addition to any other remedies
      available hereunder, whether at law or in equity. Disclosing Party shall be entitled to recover its costs and
      fees, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred in obtaining any such relief. Further, in the event of
      litigation relating to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney’s
      fees and expenses. <br><br><br>
      <b>7. Return of Confidential Information.</b> <br><br>
      Receiving Party shall immediately return and redeliver to Disclosing Party all tangible material embodying any
      Confidential Information provided hereunder and all notes, summaries, memoranda, drawings, manuals, records,
      excerpts or derivative information deriving therefrom, and all other documents or materials (“Notes”) (and all
      copies of any of the foregoing, including “copies” that have been converted to computerized media in the form of
      image, data, word processing, or other types of files either manually or by image capture) based on or including
      any Confidential Information, in whatever form of storage or retrieval, upon the earlier of (i) the completion or
      termination of the dealings between the parties contemplated hereunder; (ii) the termination of this Agreement; or
      (iii) at such time as the Disclosing Party may so request; provided however that the Receiving Party may retain
      such of its documents as is necessary to enable it to comply with its reasonable document retention policies.
      Alternatively, the Receiving Party, with the written consent of the Disclosing Party may (or in the case of Notes,
      at the Receiving Party’s option) immediately destroy any of the foregoing embodying Confidential Information (or
      the reasonably nonrecoverable data erasure of computerized data) and, upon request, certify in writing such
      destruction by an authorized officer of the Receiving Party supervising the destruction).<br><br><br>

      <b>8. Notice of Breach.</b><br><br>
      Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party immediately upon discovery of, or suspicion of, (1) any
      unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information by Receiving Party or its Representatives; or (2) any
      actions by Receiving Party or its Representatives inconsistent with their respective obligations under this
      Agreement, Receiving Party shall cooperate with any and all efforts of the Disclosing Party to help the Disclosing
      Party regain possession of Confidential Information and prevent its further unauthorized use.<br><br><br>
      <b>9. No Binding Agreement for Transaction.</b> <br><br>
      The parties agree that neither party will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to a
      Transaction by virtue of this Agreement, except for the matters specifically agreed to herein. The parties further
      acknowledge and agree that they each reserve the right, in their sole and absolute discretion, to reject any and
      all proposals and to terminate discussions and negotiations with respect to a Transaction at any time. This
      Agreement does not create a joint venture or partnership between the parties. If a Transaction goes forward, the
      non-disclosure provisions of any applicable transaction documents entered into between the parties (or their
      respective affiliates) for the Transaction shall supersede this Agreement. In the event such provision is not
      provided for in said transaction documents, this Agreement shall control.<br><br><br>

      <b>10. Warranty.</b> <br><br>
      NO WARRANTIES ARE MADE BY EITHER PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WHATSOEVER. The parties acknowledge that although they
      shall each endeavor to include in the Confidential Information all information that they each believe relevant for
      the purpose of the evaluation of a Transaction, the parties understand that no representation or warranty as to
      the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information is being made by the Disclosing Party. Further,
      neither party is under any obligation under this Agreement to disclose any Confidential Information it chooses not
      to disclose. Neither Party hereto shall have any liability to the other party or to the other party’s
      Representatives resulting from any use of the Confidential Information except with respect to disclosure of such
      Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement. The Disclosing Party shall have no liability to the
      Receiving Party (or any other person or entity) resulting from the use of the Disclosing Party's Confidential
      Information or any reliance on the accuracy or completeness thereof.<br><br><br>
      <b>11. Miscellaneous.</b><br><br>
      (a) This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties and supersedes any and all prior or
      contemporaneous understandings and agreements, whether oral or written, between the parties, with respect to the
      subject matter hereof. This Agreement can only be modified by a written amendment signed by the party against whom
      enforcement of such modification is sought.<br><br>
      (b) The validity, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance
      with the laws of state
      applicable to contracts made and to be wholly performed within such state, without giving effect to any conflict
      of laws provisions thereof. The Federal and state courts located in state shall have sole and exclusive
      jurisdiction
      over any disputes
      arising under, or in any way connected with or related to, the terms of this Agreement and Receiving Party: (i)
      consents to personal jurisdiction therein; and (ii) waives the right to raise forum non conveniens or any similar
      objection. <br><br>
      (c) Any failure by either party to enforce the other party’s strict performance of any provision of this Agreement
      will not constitute a waiver of its right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of this
      Agreement.<br><br>
      (d) Although the restrictions contained in this Agreement are considered by the parties to be reasonable for the
      purpose of protecting the Confidential Information, if any such restriction is found by a court of competent
      jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision will be modified, rewritten or interpreted to include as much of
      its nature and scope as will render it enforceable. If it cannot be so modified, rewritten or interpreted to be
      enforceable in any respect, it will not be given effect, and the remainder of the Agreement will be enforced as if
      such provision was not included.<br> <br>
      (e) Any notices or communications required or permitted to be given hereunder may be delivered by hand, deposited
      with a nationally recognized overnight carrier, electronic-mail, or mailed by certified mail, return receipt
      requested, postage prepaid, in each case, to the address of the other party first indicated above (or such other
      addressee as may be furnished by a party in accordance with this paragraph). All such notices or communications
      shall be deemed to have been given and received (a) in the case of personal delivery or electronic-mail, on the
      date of such delivery, (b) in the case of delivery by a nationally recognized overnight carrier, on the third
      business day following dispatch and (c) in the case of mailing, on the seventh business day following such
      mailing.<br><br>
      (f) This Agreement is personal in nature, and neither party may directly or indirectly assign or transfer it by
      operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent will not be
      unreasonably withheld. All obligations contained in this Agreement shall extend to and be binding upon the parties
      to this Agreement and their respective successors, assigns and designees.<br><br>
      (g) The receipt of Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement will not prevent or in any way limit either
      party from: (i) developing, making or marketing products or services that are or may be competitive with the
      products or services of the other; or (ii) providing products or services to others who compete with the
      other.<br><br>
      (h) Paragraph headings used in this Agreement are for reference only and shall not be used or relied upon in the
      interpretation of this Agreement.<br><br><br>
